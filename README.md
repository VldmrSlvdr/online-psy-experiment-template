[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh_hans.md) | [日本語](REAME.ja.md)

## Introduction 

This repo is an open source templates collection of psychology experiment based on `Lab.js`.
The picked up templates are well-tested and expected to be handy bases for any extensions to fit most of practice needs of experimental psychology researchers. 

## How to use

Please refer to [lab.js](https://lab.js.org/) for the general introduction of `lab.js`, a free, open, online study builder.  

### Download templates 

This repo shares the direct outputs of `lab.js`, thus all the templates are json files which could be easily imported and applied. 
You could use following code download all of the templates:
```
git clone https://github.com/VldmrSlvdr/online-psy-experiment-template.git
```
or, download specific file by click "Download raw file" button.

## Acknowledgements

This repo is an open source project that welcome any contribution and feedback. 
I wish that the templates could serve the experimental psychology community and students who are suffering with coding by providing flexible as well as standardized formats and workflow to save the cost and could explore more interesting methods.
